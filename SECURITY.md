## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have security concerns, please join the [Psifi Solutions Discord](https://psifisolutions.com/discord) and tag me `Psi#2741` in the `#psifi-support` channel advising you have security concerns you wish to discuss.

Please note that even if I am online on Discord, it does not mean I will be immediately available, I will respond ASAP.
